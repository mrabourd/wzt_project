				Seeking asylum means you are asking for a country’s protection because you are in danger
				as you have been persecuted and threatened in
				your country of origin due to your religion,
				nationality, political opinion, race or social
				group.
				The asylum procedure determines whether
				you are eligible to become a refugee.
				Refugee status and subsidiary protection
				enable you to be protected by the French state:

			<div className="mt-4">
				•  You can ask to have your family come over
